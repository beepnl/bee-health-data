<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookie Policy</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We use cookies to help improve your experience of Beep&rsquo;s website. This cookie policy is part of Beep\'s privacy policy, and covers the use of cookies between your device and our site. We also provide basic information on third-party services we may use, who may also use cookies as part of their service, though they are not covered by our policy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you don&rsquo;t wish to accept cookies from us, you should instruct your browser to refuse cookies from Beehealthdata.org, with the understanding that we may be unable to provide you with some of your desired content and services.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is a cookie?</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A cookie is a small piece of data that a website stores on your device when you visit, typically containing information about the website itself, a unique identifier that allows the site to recognise your web browser when you return, additional data that serves the purpose of the cookie, and the lifespan of the cookie itself.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies are used to enable certain features (eg. logging in), to track site usage (eg. analytics), to store your user settings (eg. timezone, notification preferences), and to personalise your content (eg. advertising, language).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies set by the website you are visiting are normally referred to as &ldquo;first-party cookies&rdquo;, and typically only track your activity on that particular site. Cookies set by other sites and companies (ie. third parties) are called &ldquo;third-party cookies&rdquo;, and can be used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party service.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Types of cookies and how we use them</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essential cookies</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Essential cookies are crucial to your experience of a website, enabling core features like user logins, account management, shopping carts and payment processing. We use essential cookies to enable certain functions on our website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Performance cookies</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Performance cookies are used in the tracking of how you use a website during your visit, without collecting personal information about you. Typically, this information is anonymous and aggregated with information tracked across all site users, to help companies understand visitor usage patterns, identify and diagnose problems or errors their users may encounter, and make better strategic decisions in improving their audience&rsquo;s overall website experience. These cookies may be set by the website you&rsquo;re visiting (first-party) or by third-party services. We do not use this type of cookie on our site.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Functionality cookies</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Functionality cookies are used in collecting information about your device and any settings you may configure on the website you&rsquo;re visiting (like language and timezone settings). With this information, websites can provide you with customised, enhanced or optimised content and services. These cookies may be set by the website you&rsquo;re visiting (first-party) or by third-party service. We do not use this type of cookie on our site.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Targeting/advertising cookies</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Targeting/advertising cookies are used in determining what promotional content is more relevant and appropriate to you and your interests. Websites may use them to deliver targeted advertising or to limit the number of times you see an advertisement. This helps companies improve the effectiveness of their campaigns and the quality of content presented to you. These cookies may be set by the website you&rsquo;re visiting (first-party) or by third-party services. Targeting/advertising cookies set by third-parties may be used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party service. We do not use this type of cookie on our site.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third-party cookies on our site</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We may employ third-party companies and individuals on our websites&mdash;for example, analytics providers and content partners. We grant these third parties access to selected information to perform specific tasks on our behalf. They may also set third-party cookies in order to deliver the services they are providing. Third-party cookies can be used to track you on other websites that use the same third-party service. As we have no control over third-party cookies, they are not covered by Beep\'s cookie policy.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our third-party privacy promise</span></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We review the privacy policies of all our third-party providers before enlisting their services to ensure their practices align with ours. We will never knowingly include third-party services that compromise or violate the privacy of our users.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">How you can control or opt out of cookies</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you do not wish to accept cookies from us, you can instruct your browser to refuse cookies from our website. Most browsers are configured to accept cookies by default, but you can update these settings to either refuse cookies altogether, or to notify you when a website is trying to set or update a cookie.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you browse websites from multiple devices, you may need to update your settings on each individual device.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although some cookies can be blocked with little impact on your experience of a website, blocking all cookies may mean you are unable to access certain features and content across the sites you visit.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1><span style="font-weight: 400;">Children\'s Privacy Policy</span></h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We are committed to protecting the privacy of children who use Beep&rsquo;s website and its services. This children&rsquo;s privacy policy is part of our approach to privacy, and covers the way we collect, store and manage information provided by children under the age of 13, in accordance with the US Children&rsquo;s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We encourage parents to engage with us in protecting their children&rsquo;s privacy, ensuring a safe and enjoyable online experience.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Collecting information from children</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At times, we may require information from children to enable participation in certain activities, for example, registering an account, customising a profile, or receiving notifications. When collecting non-personal information, we encourage children never to provide any details that may personally identify them or reveal their location. We do not require children to provide more information than is necessary to participate in an activity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not use children&rsquo;s contact details for marketing purposes, though we may use them for our internal marketing and research in order to improve the quality of products and services offered across our site.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parental consent</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In accordance with COPPA, if an activity does require any personal information (such as first name, last name, or email address), we will provide notice to and seek consent from a parent or guardian prior to collecting the information. We only retain collected information for as long as necessary to enable participation in the requested activity.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the event we discover we have collected personal information in a manner non-compliant with COPPA, we will either delete the information or seek parental consent.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a parent/guardian, if you believe your child is participating in an activity that collects personal information, and you have not received a notification or request for consent, please feel free to get in touch via the contact page. We do not use parent contact details for marketing purposes unless marketing materials are explicitly requested.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Safeguarding children&rsquo;s privacy</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We take security seriously, and do what we can within commercially acceptable means to protect your child&rsquo;s personal information from loss or theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. That said, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and cannot guarantee absolute data security.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Information abuse and community misconduct</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not tolerate doxing (publishing of private or personal information about an individual without their consent), cyberbullying, or other forms of information abuse on Beep&rsquo;s website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If we discover that a child&rsquo;s personal information has been disclosed on our site without the express consent of their parent/guardian, we will remove the content in question as quickly as possible and effect disciplinary measures (a warning, suspension or ban) on the offending account.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Third-party access to information</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We do not knowingly disclose any personally identifying information or personal information provided by children to third parties. We may, however, disclose anonymised and aggregated versions of this information (analytics and statistics) for business, marketing or public relations purposes.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><span style="font-weight: 400;">Parental controls and intervention</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a parent/guardian, you may at any time refuse to let us collect further information from your children for a particular activity or account. If you have given us consent previously, you may log in to your child&rsquo;s account to review, <a href="https://htmleditor.tools/" rel="nofollow">edit or</a> delete the information, or contact us via to request the removal of the information from our records.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please be aware that the removal of certain information may result in the termination of the associated account, or withdrawal from the associated activity.</span></p>
